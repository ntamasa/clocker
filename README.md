# Clocker

Clocker is a web application created to study and gain experience with JavaScript. The primary purpose of the application is to display the time in different time zones using the built-in Geolocation API and the Three.js library.

## Project Overview

Clocker is designed to show the time in various time zones. It uses the Geolocation API to get the user's position and display the current time there, as well as the global GMT+0 time. Users can add additional time zones through a form input. The design features a large circle split horizontally, with a spinning globe at the bottom and time displays in the upper section.

## Features

- **Geolocation API**: Automatically get and display the user's current time zone.
- **Global Time**: Display the current GMT+0 time.
- **Add Time Zone**: Form input allows users to add and display additional time zones.
- **Three.js Globe**: A spinning globe visualization using the Three.js Globe.js library.
- **Interactive Design**: The upper circle displays the user's current time, global time, and any added time zones.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content on the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the web pages.
- **Sass**: A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactive functionality to the web pages.
- **Geolocation API**: To get the user's current position.
- **Three.js**: For 3D graphics and animations.
- **Globe.js**: A library for rendering a spinning globe.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ntamasa/clocker.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd clocker
    ```
3. **Open the project in your favorite code editor**.
4. **Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the application**.

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the application. The application will:

1. Display your current time based on your geolocation.
2. Show the global GMT+0 time.
3. Allow you to add additional time zones through a form.

## Future Updates

There may be updates and new features added to this project in the future as I continue to learn and apply new concepts. Stay tuned for more enhancements!
